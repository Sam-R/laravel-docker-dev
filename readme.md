# Docker Laravel

A docker-compose environment for simple PHP/MySQL development. Setup for Laravel by default.

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Your website | http://localhost:8080 |
| Horizon | http://localhost:8080/horizon |
| Telescope | http://localhost:8080/telescope |
| MailHog | http://localhost:8025 |
| XDebug | port 9000 |


## Basic Usage

```
├── .docker                 # Docker files, includes and associated dockery things
├── docker-compose.yml      # the glue for this docker-compose magick
├── readme.md               # You're here!
└── src                     # Your Laravel project's code should be here
    └── public              # The default web directory, normal PHP code goes here if not using Laravel!

```
Place your laravel project in `src`. (If you're just using PHP, you'll need to place your index file in `src/public`)

run `sudo docker-compose up -d` to start the environment. The first time around this will build the PHP dockerfile so it will take some time!

You should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view your application.

If you get permissions errors on files, check your user ID on the host by running `id` in a terminal. The dockerfile is set to `1000`, if yours doesn't match, change the docker file `.docker/Dockerfile.app` to reflect your user id.

**NOTE**: You may want to remove all the _*existing*_ repository information with `find . | grep "\.git/" | xargs rm -rf`, otherwise your git commands may work against this repository instead of your own!

### Exact steps I take

download, git clone or get the docker files to your local machine somehow and go into the directory.

run `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel src` to create a new Laravel project in the `src` directory. **NOTE** files must be owned by the user ID `1000` in this setup. You may need to change ownership manually. If you're on a multi-user system this may not be a good repository for you!

I am using Laravel 6.x and need to edit settings in my `.env` file to match `docker-compose.yml`. I change the following settings:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=laravel
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

run `docker-compose up -d` to create and run the containers.

I can now go to my browser and see the default Laravel welcome page.

I run `sudo docker exec -it php-dev bash` in a terminal so I can easily run my PHP artisan commands.

### Artisan commands

You can run artisan and composer commands from inside the PHP container. `sudo docker exec -it php-dev /bin/bash` will connect a persistent console. Use `php artisan migrate` to test the database connection is established (you may have to edit your `.env` file in your laravel project to match this setup).

### Mailhog

To use mailhog, you need to setup your laravel `.env` file as follows:

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mailhog
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=test@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

Other `MAIL` lines should not be required and may cause errors, it's suggested you remove them.

## Horizon and Telescope

### Install Horizon

```
sudo docker exec -it php-dev composer require laravel/horizon
sudo docker exec -it php-dev php artisan horizon:install
sudo docker exec -it php-dev php artisan migrate
```

http://localhost:8080/horizon


### install Telescope

```
# Dev flag used for safety; you don't want to run _default_ telescope in production!
sudo docker exec -it php-dev composer require laravel/telescope --dev
sudo docker exec -it php-dev php artisan telescope:install
sudo docker exec -it php-dev php artisan migrate
php artisan telescope:publish
```

http://localhost:8080/telescope


### XDebug

XDebug is setup to talk to port 9000 on the docker host machine. You'll need to configure your IDE to accept connections on port 9000.

I'd suggest using PHPStorm or a free IDE like Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/php with the PHP Debug pluging: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug Other options include Netbeans and Eclipse. Sublime text and Atom also have limted XDebug capabilities.

Under debug on visual studio code (left hand bar) click "add configuration". This is my complete configuration file:

```
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for XDebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9000,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/var/www/html": "${workspaceFolder}/src"
            },
            "xdebugSettings": {
                "show_hidden": 1
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Launch currently open script",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "cwd": "${fileDirname}",
            "port": 9000
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: You may have to change your firewall to allow connections on port 9000

## Removing containers/resetting database

Docker can persist volumes. Make sure they're removed if changing the database (eg renaming it):

Stop the docker containers
`sudo docker-compose down`

Delete all volumes from stopped containers
`sudo docker-compose rm -v`
